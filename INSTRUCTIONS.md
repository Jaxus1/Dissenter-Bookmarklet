# Dissenter-Bookmarklet
A simple bookmarklet for Dissenter.com that allows you to comment on any web page on the internet.

To use this bookmarklet, simply follow instructions for your browser: 

Google Chrome, Firefox, and some other Chromium based browsers: Copy the code and drag it into your bookmarks bar. 
Make sure the bookmarks bar is visible on your browser. Then, Change the name to something like "Dissenter" if you want. 
Edit: If you are using Google Chrome on linux, you may have to follow the Opera instructions (except the 'heart' is instead a star)

Opera instructions: Go to any website, and click the heart on the far right of the URL bar to "add to bookmarks", and select "bookmarks bar", then, on the bookmarks bar, right click > edit the bookmark you just added, and replace the Address with the bookmarklet code, and the name to whatever you'd like. 

After you add it to your bookmarks bar, make sure you're logged in on https://dissenter.com or you won't be able to comment or rate the posts, however you'll still be able to see the comments, due to a new update to Dissenter.

OTHER BROWSERS: since i cant be bothwred to download and test every browser, below is basic instructions for all browsers:
Make a bookmark with the URL field set as the code. Some browsers allow you to modify it when you make the bookmark, but sometimes you have to make a bookmark, and then right click  >  edit.

Microsoft Edge: Unfortunately, Microsoft Edge, (The worst browser in existence following internet explorer) has no support for extensions or bookmarklets, so you're out of luck, or you can try finding a tutorial online, but those aren't guaranteed to work, and when i looked at one, it had several steps you had to go through, and its more worth just getting a better browser.
