<details><summary>UC Browser</summary>
<p>

### No.

I tried using UC browser on my 300 dollar phone, and it lagged it because it is bloatware and has tons of adware (and likely malware). I uninstalled it immediately. It's so bad, it was even removed from Google play in November of 2017 for 30 days for sending sensitive user data to China, as well as showing misleading and malicious ads to its users. UC browser is made by UCWeb. The chairman of UCWeb is Lei Jun. The CEO of Xiaomi, chairman of Kingsoft and YY.com is also Lei Jun. Kingsoft owns Cheetah Mobile, who makes Clean Master. Clean Master is also bloatware and has excessive advertisements, and Xiamoi literally has built in bloatware and adware. 
The same person is behind Xiaomi, UC browser and clean master. I very highly suggest you change browsers.

After you add it to your bookmarks bar, make sure you're logged in on https://dissenter.com or you won't be able to comment or rate the posts. To use a bookmarklet, you must click the bookmark.

I've been working tirelessly to try to get as many browsers as I can. I understand that people come from all walks of life, and might not be using chrome, firefox, or opera. I have several desktop browsers I will be testing very soon. These browsers are Otter browser, SRW Iron, Dooble, Basilisk, Côc Côc (Vietnamese browser), Comodo Dragon, Comodo Ice Dragon, Slimjet, Icecat, 360 secure, Torch, Epic Privacy Browser, Avast Secure Browser, Blisk browser, Colibri.

There are also other web browsers that I may consider as well, including  Xvast, Polarity, TheWorld Chrome, Naver Whale, Kinza, Iridium, Tungsten, Ghost Browser, Superbird, Lulumi, Chedot, Orbitum, Cent Browser.

After I'm done adding those browsers, I'll move back to Android browsers. At least, ones with a branded name. Browsers like "Browser", "Browser", "Browser with adblock", "Browser that is the best", etc. wont be included, as i can't assure that you'll get the correct instructions.
