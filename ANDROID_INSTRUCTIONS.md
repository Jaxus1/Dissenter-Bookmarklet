Bookmarklets currently do not work with DuckDuckGo browser.

Bookmarklets currently do not work with Firefox Focus, as it doesn't have the option to add bookmarks.

You can't add bookmarklets to Cake browser, due to the inability of editing the bookmark URL.

You can't add bookmarklets to "Opera Touch", as Opera Touch doesn't have bookmarks.

More instructions for other browsers coming soon... The instructions should be similar to the ones above, though.
