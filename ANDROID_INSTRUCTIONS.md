# Dissenter-Bookmarklet
You must be logged in to the site comment and rate. Due to a recent update to Dissenter, it now no longer redirects to the home page if you aren't logged in, and allows you to use this bookmarklet without an account. Thanks Torba!

(Warning: some of the URLs are showed different on some browsers, and as such, some URLs will load on dissenter to the wrong page. Some notable examples are: google.com, news.google.com, facebook, etc.)

Unsupported browsers: PHX browser, DuckDuckGo, Puffin, Cm browser, Maxthon, 'Firefox Focus', Cake browser,'Opera Touch'. 

I did not even try with UC browser because its so shitty and laggy (lagging on my 300 dollar phone, lol), i uninstalled it almost instantly. If you seriously like UC browser, i feel sympathy for your loss. I highly recommend you switch to a less shitty browser.

More instructions for other browsers coming soon... The instructions should be similar to the ones above, though.
